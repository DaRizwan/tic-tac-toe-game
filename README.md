# tic-tac-toe-game

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features an interactive and user-friendly interface designed with CSS for an engaging visual experience. JavaScript powers the game logic, enabling two players to compete in real-time. It includes features such as turn-based gameplay, win condition detection, and an option to reset the game for multiple rounds. This project was developed during a summer internship to demonstrate practical skills in front-end development and game logic design.
